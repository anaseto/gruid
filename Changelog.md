## v0.3.0 - ?

+ Renamed Menu.Style.Selected into Menu.Style.Active (incompatible change)

## v0.2.0 - 2020-12-25

+ Improvements in ui widgets and examples.
+ Astar now returns the path in normal order instead of reversed (incompatible
  change), which made sense from an algorithm point of view but was
  unintuitive.

## v0.1.0 - 2020-12-24

First release of Gruid.
