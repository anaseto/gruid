The package sdl provides a gruid Driver using the SDL2 library via the go-sdl2
bindings. For it to work, you need to install the [SDL2
library](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) on your system before.

Be sure to install the dev version of the package, for distributions that make
such a distinction. For example, in Debian-derived systems, a command like `apt
install libsdl2-dev` may be used.
