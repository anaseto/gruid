This tcell package depends on the [tcell](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/v2)
terminal library, which uses the permissive enough [Apache License
v2](https://github.com/gdamore/tcell/blob/master/LICENSE). The library is pure
Go, so no special steps are required to install it, and it allows for easy
cross-compilation.

You only need to look into the `tcell.Style` type documentation to define the
styling that has to be used by the Driver.
